udacity Front End Developer Nano Degree Program Unit 3 Memory Game

**A Travel Take on a Classic Memory Game**
This simple childhood game tests a users memory. There's a deck of cards with different travel related icons

### Rules of the Game ###
Turn over any two cards
If the two cards match, keep them
If they don't match, they turn back over
Remember what was on each card and where it was
The game is over when all the cards have been matched

### Construction ###
*I used the original Unit 2 Project Submission as the base for the memory game application

*Using Javascript to apply event listeners, for loops, manipulating the DOM and an assortment of arrays to execute the game functionality
*counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
*added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched
